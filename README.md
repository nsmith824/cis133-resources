# Assignment 1.13 Your favorite HTML and CSS resource

https://www.freecodecamp.org/

About a year ago, I tried to use this website to learn Java or Javascript, I can't remember which. This site also has HTML and CSS, so if you were interested in any of those languages, you can learn about them. It's very helpful because it starts you out at the very basic level of programming and builds you up to the more advanced stuff. There's an also environment built into the website, so you don't need to figure out how to set up Visual Studio or anything like that.
