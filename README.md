# Assignment 1.13 Your favorite HTML and CSS resource

https://www.codecademy.com/
About a year ago, I tried to use this website to learn Java or Javascript, I can't remember which. It's very helpful because it starts you out at the very basic level of programming and builds you up to the more advanced stuff. I went to double check, and this site also has CSS and HTML options on top of the Java. Back then, I was more interested in learning Java because I had previous experience working with C++, and I read somewhere that the two languages were pretty similar to each other.
